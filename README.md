# IR_Plan_Playbook_Policy
I conducted a case study on the Royal Bank of Canada, formulating 8 policy sets and 4 distinct procedures. These will activate the provided data breach playbook, with outlined policy benefits for the organization and stakeholders.
Created a Policy Set, clearly attaching it to a Playbook. Generated separate procedures that call (activate) the Playbook. Utilized the NIST 7-step incident process for this project and submitted a slideshow that explains “Why” the policy is being created, and the consequences of non-compliance to both the company and the individual.
